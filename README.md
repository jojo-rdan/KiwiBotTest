# Project - KiwiBot Devilery Control System test

## About the project:

  I made this project as a technical test for a private company. I built a complete website from Back to Front and using Firebase for the DB.

  - Database:
      - Firebase service

  - Back-end:
      - Node.js
      - Express

  - Front-end:
      - React.js
      - Axios
        
  - Functionality:
      - The user will be able to keep track of the various deliveries, see their creation schedule, change their status and create new deliveries.
      - The user will also have a fleet of KiwiBots to be able to assign them to the deliveries that you have pending shipments and will also be able to create new Kiwibots if necessary.
      - There is also a boton that filters deliveries by creation date, ascending or descending.
      - There is also an option to filter deliveries by the status of the shipment.
      - In case of orders that have been in a "pending" state for more than 5 minutes, a warning will be displayed.

 ## How to start the project:
 
   - Clone the repo and open it with your code editor.
   - Open a terminal over the client folder and the api folder.
   - Run npm install over the client and the api folders.
   - Run nodemon index.js over the api folder in your terminal to run the server.
   - Run npm start over the client folder in your terminal to run the client.
